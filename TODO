Analytics
    - Set color scheme to look good
    - download pngs
    - Total Hashes Cracked vs uncracked
    - Total unique cracked vs uncracked
    - Top 20 users per single hash/password
    - All duplicates?
    - Both Bar graphs should render widths dynamically
    - Show users based on matching hashes
    - show users based on matching cracked passwords
    - Change to seperate json queries per portlet
    - Show instacrack rate
    - Top passwords across customers
    - Change download left/found list to be based on hashtype when user selects all hashfiles all customers

API
    - support VERSION info being sent from agents to server
    - Check if all hashes cracked upon agent check in, and if all are cracked, cancel task/job
    - when syncing wordlists need to use random names, and not file names. otherwise new agents will will collide requests and the tmp directory file entry will be overwritten

Search
    - Do we even let the user pick which type, or just run queries on both?
    - Export Results

Wordlists
    - Change wordlist path attribute in db to be relative to app install path
        - does this affect the path returned by the API to agents?
    - Dynamic wordlist based on usernames

Rules
    - Edit 
        - Rules in browser
        
Login
    - Should be a card style

Tasks
    - add support for markov chains
    - dynamic task with top X masks (isnt this the same thing as markov)
    - Add support for Cewl

Jobs
    - New job
        - New Hashfile
            - Unique sort or error on netntlmv1, netntlmv2 hashes that share the same username
        - Notifications should come before task selection
        - Notifications
            - pre select email & hash notificaitons if previously set
            - Check all / none hashes 
            - in table filter for user/hash
        - Job Tasks
            - Remove all tasks
        - Stop Job after X ammount of successfully cracked hashes
        - Stop Job after X ammount of time warning and preset
        - Stop Task after X ammont of time warnning and preset
    - Prevent Editing of Job that is activly running

Scheduled Events
    - Status (is running / died)
    - Mark agent as inactive after a period of time
    - send push notifications when agent is offline

        - Jobs
        - Notifications

Users
    - Add admin, or promote existing user to admin (if admin)
    - Delete

            - wordlists
            - jobs
            - tasks

        - Associated Hash_notifications
        - Associated Job_notifications
        - Associated Hashfiles
        - Associated Rules (We're going to run into a problem when an associated rule is used in a task assigned to a job thats not associated to this user)
        - Associated Task_groups (same as above)
        - Associated Tasks (same as above)
    - Add last login date to track stale users

All
    - change uri scheme to be consistent
        - jobs/id/status
        - jobs/delete/id
        - agents/delete/id
    - When all hashes are cracked, all active tasks should be killed

Standardize modals
    - info
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users
    - delete
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users

Hashfiles
    - Dynamic Hashfiles based on hashtype (uncracked)

Home
    - make home page multiple jobs collapsable or only see your jobs

Core
    - Support for compressed wordlists

Agents
    - Change agent manifest to json
    - Check / validate hashcat versions before exeuction
    - Move compressed download out of install folder

Utils
    - Validate hash can be simplified. user:hash vs hash only, the hash_types code can be reused.

# Bugs
tasks that use dynamic wordlists do not update keyspace count (maybe we should just remove keyspace count all together)

# Before Release
Include upgrade instructions for agents
Documnent Invalid certificate error and how to fix them on wiki
Prevent adding of task to new job when assigning a task group and there's already a duplicate task.
