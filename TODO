Analytics
    - I think outerjoins should be .joins
    - Set color scheme to look good
    - download pngs
    - Total Hashes Cracked vs uncracked
    - Total unique cracked vs uncracked
    - Top 10 masks
    - Top 20 users per single hash/password
    - All duplicates?
    - Both Bar graphs should render widths dynamically
    - Show users based on matching hashes
    - show users based on matching cracked passwords
    - Change to seperate json queries per portlet
    - Show instacrack rate
    - Top passwords across customers

API
    - support VERSION info being sent from agents to server

Search
    - Do we even let the user pick which type, or just run queries on both?
    - Export Results

Wordlists
    - Change wordlist path attribute in db to be relative to app install path
        - does this affect the path returned by the API to agents?
    - Dynamic wordlist based on usernames

Rules
    - Edit 
        - Rules in browser
        
Login
    - Should be a card style

Scheduled Events
    - Status (is running / died)
    - Mark agent as inactive after a period of time

Installation Instructions:
Installation files
    - upgrade.sh
        - export FLASK_APP=hashview.py 
            - flask db migrate
            - flask db upgrade 
        - What do we do with previous wordlists/rules and dynamic wordlist?

Wiki Instructions

Settings
    - OPTIMIZE TABLE hashes;
    - OPTIMIZE TABLE hashfile_hashes;
    - Max runtime for jobs
    - Max runtime for tasks
    - Max timeout from agents

Add favicon

taskgroups / hashfiles should probably be renamed to task_groups and hash_files, word_lists?

Change dropdown alignment of jobs, tasks, manage (in templates/layout.html)

Form layout
    - Adjust label\nfield to label field\n
        - Task

        - Task Lists
        - Task Groups
        - Rules
        - Jobs
        - Notifications

Users
    - Add admin, or promote existing user to admin (if admin)
    - Delete   
        - Remove all or migrate all
            - wordlists
            - jobs

        - Associated Rules (We're going to run into a problem when an associated rule is used in a task assigned to a job thats not associated to this user)
        - Associated Task_groups (same as above)
        - Associated Tasks (same as above)

All
    - change uri scheme to be consistent
        - jobs/id/status
        - jobs/delete/id
        - agents/delete/id
    - When all hashes are cracked, all active tasks should be killed

Standardize modals
    - info
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users
    - delete
        - jobs
        - wordlists
        - rules
        - users

# Next Phase
General
    - Add ability for users / admins? to import plaintext's and auto convert to specific hashes
Jobs
    - Increase speed of importation of new hashes

profile -> pushover notification when null auto populates

filter imports for usernames that contain non english characters
filter krbtgt account?
filter rules file that contain non-english characters

Dynamic hashfile based on hashtype.
dynamic task with top X masks

show notification selection on table load if previously selected by the user

# COMPLETE BEFORE OPEN BETA
- Grey out pushover option in hash notifications
- Test if user can reset password to something < 14 chars long

Analytics will show blank entries for top 10/password count by length as empty if password is blank.

Homepage agent status window (connected, disconnected, busy, etc)

send push notifications when agent is offline

on job summary, shows notifications as true when none are set for the user.
tasks that use dynamic wordlists do not update keyspace count (maybe we should just remove keyspace count all together)

Include upgrade instructions for agents
when we upgrade agent the manifest files are overwitten

Include link with email/job notification

Invalid certificate error

Remove task groups number of tasks

select all option for hash notifications
```
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("#select-all").click(function () {
        $('input[name=hashes]').prop("checked" , true);
    }
    $("#select-none").click(function () {
        $('input[name=hashes]').prop("checked" , false);
    }
}
```

remove all tasks in task assignments
check all/ check none in hash notification table

Disable test push notification button until values are set.

remove 'none:' in downloaded hashes that dont have a username

make home page multiple jobs collapsable or only see your jobs


Remove .vscode from repo
