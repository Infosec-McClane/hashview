    - OPTIMIZE TABLE hashes;
    - OPTIMIZE TABLE hashfile_hashes;
    - Max runtime for jobs
    - Max runtime for tasks
    - Max timeout from agents

Add favicon

taskgroups / hashfiles should probably be renamed to task_groups and hash_files, word_lists?

Change dropdown alignment of jobs, tasks, manage (in templates/layout.html)

        - Associated Task_groups (same as above)
        - Associated Tasks (same as above)

All
    - change uri scheme to be consistent
        - jobs/id/status
        - jobs/delete/id
        - agents/delete/id
    - When all hashes are cracked, all active tasks should be killed

Standardize modals
    - info
        - jobs
        - wordlists

# Next Phase
General
    - Add ability for users / admins? to import plaintext's and auto convert to specific hashes
Jobs
    - Increase speed of importation of new hashes

filter imports for usernames that contain non english characters
filter krbtgt account?
filter rules file that contain non-english characters

Dynamic hashfile based on hashtype.
dynamic task with top X masks

show notification selection on table load if previously selected by the user (might be for anyuser)

on job summary, shows notifications as true when none are set for the user.
tasks that use dynamic wordlists do not update keyspace count (maybe we should just remove keyspace count all together)

Include upgrade instructions for agents
when we upgrade agent the manifest files are overwitten

Include link with email/job notification

Invalid certificate error

select all option for hash notifications
```
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("#select-all").click(function () {
        $('input[name=hashes]').prop("checked" , true);
    }
    $("#select-none").click(function () {
        $('input[name=hashes]').prop("checked" , false);
    }
}
```

make home page multiple jobs collapsable or only see your jobs

Remove .vscode from repo

Prevent adding of task to new job when assigning a task group and there's already a duplicate task.

Support for compressed wordlists

upload rockyou2021

sums of  composition makeups do not equal total cracked

split notifications and select hashes into seperate pages\

Change agent manifest to json

Change download left/found list to be based on hashtype when user selects all hashfiles all customers

when syncing wordlists need to use random names, and not file names. otherwise new agents will will collide requests and the tmp directory file entry will be overwritten
